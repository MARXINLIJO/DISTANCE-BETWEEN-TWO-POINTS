# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
 Read the question carefully .
### Step 2: 
by given that the cordinates points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the import math and find the distance.
### Step 5: 
to round of the floatvalue use round() function.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1=10
y1=6
x2=4
y2=2
d=math.sqrt(((x1-x2)**2+(y1-y2)**2)) 
print(round(d,2))
```
### OUTPUT:
